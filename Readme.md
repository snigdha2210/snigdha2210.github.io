# Snigdha Tiwari - Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project is designed to showcase my work, experience, and skills as a Software Developer. It features an interactive background with particles and smooth animations, all developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Particle Background**: A visually appealing particle system that interacts with the user's cursor, adding an engaging dynamic to the website.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for various devices, ensuring smooth navigation and content display on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Smooth Animations**: Hover effects and transitions to improve user experience and add a professional touch to the design.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Markup structure of the website.
- **CSS3**: For styling, animations, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and handling the particle effects.
